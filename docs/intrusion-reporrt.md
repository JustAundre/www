### Compromises

The AD was compromised via local persistence and credential theft. The attacker established a "beachhead" using elevated service accounts and modified registry permissions to prevent administrative removal of malicious tasks.

### Attacker Persistence

Analysis of the `HKLM` registry hive and system logs identified three primary methods of persistence:

- Registry Hijacking: The attacker applied a custom Security Descriptor (SD) to the `TaskCache`\Tree registry keys. This created a "logic lock" that returned Access Denied errors even when the Domain Administrator attempted to delete the malicious entries.     Malicious Scheduled Tasks: Two specific back-doors were identified:

- Fake *"Proxy"*: Likely used for command-and-control (C2) tunneling.
- Fake *"Windows Error Reporting"*: A masqueraded task used to execute malicious binaries with SYSTEM-level privileges.
- **Unauthorized Account**: A back-door local user named `scrat` was created and assigned to the local Administrator
- **Password Complexity**: Not quite persistence in the traditional methods, however the password complexity requirements were raised to extremely high standards to inhibit our retrieval of compromised credentials.
- **De-escalation**: Removed our permissions to view `sysvol.`

### Remediation Actions Taken

Following a full remediation protocol—including ownership seizure and Kerberos key rotation—the system has been stabilized and unauthorized access has been terminated.

To reclaim the environment, the following engineering steps were executed:

- Ownership Seizure: The attacker had practically *locked* the registry keys, the `Owner` attribute was manually reassigned to the `Administrators` group. The "`Replace owner on sub-containers and objects`" flag was utilized to force-propagate permissions down to the hidden malicious tasks, *allowing for their successful deletion*.

- Kerberos Invalidation: the attacker had achieved `SYSTEM` access, the Domain's Kerberos keys were considered compromised—to invalidate any forged "Golden Tickets," the following was performed:

	- `krbtgt` Password Rotation: The password for the `krbtgt` account was reset twice.

	- Ticket Cache Purge: The command `klist purge -li 0x3e7` was executed to clear all existing tickets from the `SYSTEM` session memory.

- Service Hardening Several services frequently used for pivoting were audited and disabled to prevent re-infection:    

	- Disabled `WinHttpAutoProxySvc`.

	- Template Services: Registry-level hardening was applied to `CDPUserSvc` and `OneSyncSvc` to prevent them from acting as triggers for the attacker's scripts.

## Current Security Posture

- Persistence Status: All "Proxy" and "Error Reporting" tasks have been deleted from both the Registry and the physical `C:\Windows\System32\Tasks` directory.

- Account Status: The scrat user has been removed.

- Integrity Check: A `WMI` audit confirmed no "*headless*" Event Consumers remain in the root\subscription name-space.

- Verification: Post-remediation logs show no further unauthorized Event 4672 (Special Privileges Assigned) logins.
