# [Shellcam](https://github.com/JustAundre/ass-suite/tree/main/shellcam)

## Dependencies

Must have/use the below:
- SSHD

## Installation

Change directory into this directory & run the installation script
```bash
cd shellcam
./install.sh
```

## Feature Set

1. Full session logging to text files
	- You see what the user sees.
	- Append-only while live, immutable when done.
	- Logging on the root level, user on the user level. Non-privileged users can't stop the logging.
	- If the logging dies, the shell dies--simple.
2. Bash history files cannot be deleted; only new entries may be added!
3. Username on the file stays consistent, even across commands such as `sudo -i`, `sudo su` & `sudo bash`.

Use the below to queue up all logs (descending from newest) for viewing and then select which to delete after review.
(Alternatively, you can wrap the below in a `function() {}` and put in your `~/.bashrc` file to easily call.)

```bash
mapfile -t logs < <(ls -1t /var/log/sessions/*)

for log in "${logs[@]}"; do
	less -R "${log}" && read -rp "Delete (${log})?: " del
	if [[ "${del}" =~ ^[yY] ]]; then
		chattr -ia "${log}"
		rm -v "${log}"
	fi
done
```

Use the below to actively monitor history files in home directories:

```bash
mapfile -t histories < <(find /home -maxdepth 2 -type f -name '*history')

for history in "${histories[@]}"; do
	printf 'Monitoring %s:\n\n' "${history}"
	sleep 1.5
	tail -fn10 "${history}" &
done
```
