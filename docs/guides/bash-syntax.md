## Help You Help Yourself

The `man` command (short for "manual") is great for a comprehensive breakdown of some command, but demonstrations and examples are better for getting started with a complex command—you'll want the `tldr` command, which you can install using your preferred package manager:

```bash
# For Debian and its derivatives:
sudo apt install tldr

# For Redhat and its derivatives:
sudo dnf install tldr

# For Arch and its derivatives:
sudo pacman -S tldr
```

It generally follows the same formatting as the `man` command:

```bash
# See usage examples of basic calculator:
tldr bc
```

## Structuring A Command

For a command, you’ll have the command (*duh*) and then the arguments you pass to it.

Of course, there’s regular text arguments (see figure 1 below) but there’s also short-form opts and long-form opts (figures 2/3 respectively).

```bash
# Figure 1
# "Hello!" is a normal argument.
echo "Hello!"

# Figure 2
# Ditto, but with a "-n", which disables printing the leading newline.
echo -n "Hello!"

# Figure 3
echo --BashEchoHasNoLongformOpt "Hi!"
```

You also don’t ***have*** to quote regular arguments, but you should get used to it because they’re there for handling variables safely to prevent [command injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Command_Injection).

Also, check this out--you can combine shortform opts:

```bash
read -rp "A clean combination of -r and -p for the read command!"
```

> [!NOTE]
>
> Opts may or may not take an argument after them, it all depends on what the program wants, though usually the commands’ respective `man` page will tell you what each opt expects.

## The Shebang

You can append the `.sh` or `.bash` extension to the end of your script, but that's for *you* to use to identify, not for the system to use the correct interpreter.

That honor goes to the *shebang* , a line which is unconditionally placed at the very 1st line, which dictates what interpreter is to be used.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash
echo "The line above is a shebang to tell the system to use Bash as the interpreter"
```

The above shebang is really common, though more likely you'll want to use this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
echo 'This shebang does almost the same thing, except Bash can be anywhere in the ${PATH} that isn't /usr/bin/bash'
```

It's more flexible.dd

## Variables

### Standard Strings

Simple and straight-forward, it's just `variable=value`:

```bash
test_var="abc"
echo "${test_var}" # Result: "abc"
```

There's also fun stuff you can do with string concacenation that you can also do in a few other places where strings are involved--including [command arguments](#structuring-a-command):

```bash
foo='Hello! '
bar="$foo"'This string is single quoted and will not be interpreted even if I include a ${variable}!'
echo "${bar}" # Result: "Hello! This string is single quoted and will not be interpreted even if I include a ${variable}!"
```

### Standard Arrays

You define an array almost like a standard string but with the opening `(` and closing `)` parenthesis with the values of the array sandwhiched between, *preferably* quoted as the values need to be separated with some kind of whitespace.

```bash
example_array=(
	'test'
	'abc'
	'123'
	'xyz'
)
```

Also, arrays don't care about formatting (that much, anyway).
You can also do the below:

```bash
example_array=(test abc 123 xyz)
```

Oh yeah, this is also a good time to mention:

- `${example_array}`	resolves to only the first item in the array
- `${example_array[@]}`	resolves to all items in the array, as an array
- `${example_array[*]}`	resolves to all the items in the array, as a concacenated string
- `${example_array[0]}`	resolves to the first item in the array (yes, arrays in Bash are 0-indexed)
- `${example_array[((1 + 3))]}` resolves to `${example_array[4]}`; so yes, you can do math inside those square brackets `[]` that define the index of the array to target.

You don't HAVE to quote your strings, but please do because it keeps it looking consistent and reduces risk of a string being interpreted.
This goes double if your strings have special or even whitespace characters.

### Associative Arrays

### Nameref Variable

## Statements

### If Statements

Comprised of the initiator `if`, the result `then`, and additional conditions `elif`, an exception `else` and the closing `fi`.

The `if` statement is simple yet versatile:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

if command-a; then
	echo "command-a succeeded"
elif command-b; then
	echo "command-a failed but command-b succeeded as a fallback."
else
	echo "Neither command-a nor command-b worked."
fi
```

> [!WARNING]
>
> No, `else if` is NOT the same as `elif` .
>
> `elif` extends an already existing `if` statement,
> `else if` creates a new `if` statement, requiring you to add an extra `fi` closure.

### While/Until Statements

While/until loops generally share the same structure, and are opposites—”while loops” will loop over the commands nested inside them so long as the command provided to them exits successfully without issue, and “until loops” will do the same but so long as the given command fails.

```bash
while true; do
	echo "This loop will spam this message until you kill it."
done

until false; do
	echo "This loop will spam this message until you kill it."
done

while false; do
	echo "The false command always fails so this message will never be printed."
done

until true; do
	echo "The true command never fails so this message will never be printed."
done
```

### For Statements

`For` loops are useful **for** looping over a list/[array](#standard-arrays) of items—

<small>(Or, for those who already know a primary scripting language, useful for [C-style loops](https://example.com)).</small>

See below for examples of both:

Normal for loop:

```bash
for item in "${example_array[@]}"; do
	echo "Recieved item: ${item}"
done

# C-style loop | Defines variable i as 0, and if i is less than the amount of items in the array, add 1 to i.
for ((i=0; i<"${example_array[@]}"; i++)); do
	echo "Item number ${i}: ${example_array["${i}"]}"
done

# Don't do this:
for item in "${example_array[*]}"; do
	# Depending on a few things, this treats the entire array as 1 string, and sometimes past that will re-split the array using the IFS variable
done
```

### Case Statements

### Formatting

So, (*opinion incoming*), statements can be formatted more ways than they should be allowed to unlike Python.

Again, unlike Python, statements can mix and match delimiters—it’s better to see for yourself:

```bash
# The below is a crime against humanity, thou who scripts like this shall be ensnared in the fires of hell.
if # Newline delimiter
command-a # No, indentation won't affect interpretation.
then # Another newline delimiter
	# "Actually nevermind I wanna indent here"
	# "Too many newlines, let's use semi-colons instead."
	command-b; elif command-c; then command-d;
fi
```

## Miscellaneous Features

### Command Groups

The opening and closing curly brackets `{}` are used to group multiple commands together, and while typically indifferent from running the commands normally, can be used to manipulate an arbitrary group of commands as if they were 1 process—like piping the output of all the commands in a group to another command.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Command groups require a space after the opening curly bracket `{` and a semi-colon `;` (or a newline/another forms of acceptable delimiters by Bash) after the closing curly bracket `}` like so:
>
> ```bash
> {
> 	# Print "Hello!"
> 	# The ">&2" redirects the "Hello!" to fd2/stderr, which will make it hidden due to the directive attached to the command group.
> 	echo "Hello!" >&2
>
> 	# Gives the user a prompt and assigns it to a variable.
> 	# Note: the read command actually prints its provided prompt to fd2/stderr so 2>&1 is present to revert that
> 	read -r -p 'How are you?: ' answer_variable 2>&1
>
> 	# This is a dummy, non-existent command and will print an error.
> 	unknown_command
> } 2>/dev/null # This discards data coming from fd2/stderr.
> ```

### Sub-shells (and variable scoping)

Ditto, but `()` opposed to `{}`.

Alike command groups, but with the distinction that everything inside it runs under a new process. A "sub-shell" is ephemeral and will disappear when it finishes. As a result, the following effects can be observed, but note that this is not an exhaustive list:

- Changes in variables (*including creation and deletion* ) will not trickle up to the parent shell.
- Changes in variables (*including creation and deletion*) in the parent will not trickle down to the sub-shell *post-creation* of the sub-shell.

Here's an example:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Assign variable "foo" in parent
foo=bar

# Scope: Sub-shell
# Prints "bar".
( echo "${foo}" )

(
	# Re-assigned variable "foo" to "hello" inside of sub-shell.
	foo="hello"

	# Scope: Sub-shell
	# Prints "hello"
	echo "${foo}"
)

# Scope: Top
# Prints "bar".
echo "${foo}"
```

### Unnamed Pipes

Non-persistent inter-process communication between 2 ephemeral processes.

> [!TIP]
>
> Unnamed pipes will actually create a sub-shell, meaning the assignment or reassignment of variables inside pipes will not persist into the parent shell.

> [!NOTE]
>
> There is a better way to use bc than the method shown below, see the section regarding [here-strings](#here-string) for more info.

Signified by the vertical pipe `|` character, redirects the stdout/fd1 of `command-a` to the stdin of `command-b` . (Examples below)

```bash
# Tells bc (basic calculator) to resolve 1+1. The bc command doesn't take args, it evaluates from stdin
echo "1+1" | bc

# Finds all lines containing the substring "xyz" in the hosts file, then tee outputs it to stdout AND writes it to a file named results.txt in your CWD (current working directory).
grep "xyz" '/etc/hosts' | tee './results.txt'
```

### Named Pipes

Persistent inter-process communication, generally between a [daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) and an ephemeral process(es).

Usually made by the `mkfifo`[^First in, first out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)) command, can live beyond the lifespan of an arbitrary process—any program can put data into it, and any program can read from it, but ***both must happen simultaneously*** because the data is not stored unlike a normal file.

```bash
# Make a named pipe
mkfifo '/tmp/named_pipe'

# Start reading incoming data (backgrounded via the ampersand, see the below section.)
while read -r line; do
	echo "Received line: ${line}"
done <'/tmp/named_pipe' &

# Send data
echo 'Hello! This is a line of text.' >>'/tmp/named_pipe'
```

### Backgrounding A Process

The Ampersand `&` backgrounds a process when appended to the end of a command like so:

```bash
# This waits 10 seconds from the time of execution, then prints "hi" to the terminal while letting you run other commands in the meantime.
{ sleep 10; echo 'hi'; } &
```

### Disowning A Process

Ditto, but append " `disown` " after the ampersand `&` to background and *disown* the process.

```bash
# This variation will still continue after you close your terminal.
{ sleep 10; echo 'hi'; } & disown
```

Disowning a process means the parent process (in this scenario, your terminal) can close and the child process won't close along with the parent.

### Input Redirection

The opening angle bracket `<` feeds data into the command to the left from the file path on the right as seen below:
```bash
while read -r line; do
	echo "Line recieved: ${line}"
done <'data.txt'

```

( *Yes, a `while` loop counts as a "command"* )

### Here-string

Generally used as an alternative to the below, a here-string `<<<` (triple opening angle bracket) is much cleaner and faster:

```bash
# This is ugly and inefficient:
echo "abc" | command-b # Nope, bad!

# Try this instead:
command-b <<<"abc" # That's better.
```

Feeds a string into a command's stdin without redirecting the stdout of another command, avoids the ambiguity of variations in how `echo` operates across systems, and mitigates the (albeit very minor) performance hit from spawning sub-shells as a result of using [unnamed pipes](#unnamed-pipes).
